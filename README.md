# Parasol

Parasol is a HaxeFlixel library of shaders and supporting example code.

Currently this is mainly documentation in the doc/HFShaders.md file. I created this as the FlxShader doc and the doc for the underlying Openfl shaders is almost non-existent.

## Installation

`haxelib install parasol`
