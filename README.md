# Parasol

Parasol is a HaxeFlixel library of shaders and supporting example code.

Currently this is mainly documentation in the doc/HFShaders.md file. I created this as the FlxShader doc and the doc for the underlying Openfl shaders is almost non-existent.

## Installation

`haxelib install parasol`

## API Documentation

Full class documentation for parasol and its examples is available at (https://47rooks.github.io/parasol/parasol/index.html).
